üîç Project Overview:
In today's competitive job market, reviewing numerous resumes can be time-consuming for recruiters. To streamline the hiring process, I developed a resume classification system that automatically categorizes resumes based on their content. This project utilizes a range of powerful machine learning classifiers, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP Neural Networks, FastText, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.

üí° Key Components:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection and Preprocessing:
To train the model, I collected a diverse resume dataset and extracted the text using the textract method. After conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), I performed text cleaning and transformation using TF-IDF vectorization.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Classifiers:
I incorporated a variety of classifiers to achieve the best performance. Decision Trees and Random Forests provide interpretable results, while Logistic Regression, SVM, and Linear SVC excel in handling high-dimensional data. I also leveraged MLP Neural Networks for their ability to capture complex relationships. Additionally, I experimented with FastText, XGBoost, and AdaBoost for further comparative analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Evaluation:
The resume dataset was divided into training and testing sets, and each classifier was trained using the preprocessed data. I evaluated the performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results revealed valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier, aiding in their selection for specific use cases.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment using Streamlit:
The resume classification model was deployed using Streamlit, enabling an interactive web application for easy resume categorization. Users can conveniently upload resumes and receive instant predictions on their respective categories. The application boasts a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

üåü Future Improvements and Contributions:
Moving forward, I plan to explore advanced feature engineering techniques and incorporate additional classifiers to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model. I welcome fellow developers and machine learning enthusiasts to contribute to this project and further revolutionize the field of resume classification.

üîó References and Credits:
I would like to acknowledge the invaluable resources and libraries that facilitated this project's development. Special thanks to [list relevant resources, libraries, and datasets here]. Their contributions were instrumental in achieving the project's objectives.

üì¨ Conclusion:
Developing this Resume Classification system was a fascinating journey, enabling me to combine my passion for machine learning and talent acquisition. The project's potential to simplify the hiring process and save valuable time for recruiters is truly exciting. I am thrilled to continue working on advancements in resume classification and contribute to the evolving landscape of AI-powered recruitment.
